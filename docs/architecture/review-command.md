# `entire inspect` Command

`entire inspect` (aliased as `entire review`) runs a named review profile. A
profile defines one canonical task (for example `general`, `security`, or
`accessibility`), a set of **inspector** agents that all run that task, and a
single **judge** that consolidates the inspectors' reports into the final
verdict in a closing round. Inspector sessions are immutable facts attached to
checkpoints; the final verdict is stored locally in the review manifest for
findings/fix workflows.

## Command Surface

```
entire inspect                          # Interactive: pick a profile to run. Non-interactive: list profiles + error
entire inspect security                 # Run a named profile
entire inspect --profile accessibility  # Same, flag form
entire inspect --list                   # List configured profiles (inspectors + judge), marking the default
entire inspect --configure                    # Interactive: guided wizard. Non-interactive: list agents + profiles
entire inspect --configure --profile general --set-agents claude-code,codex --set-judge claude-code --set-output trail
                                               # Configure a profile non-interactively (no TUI)
entire inspect --configure --profile sec --set-slot claude-code=opus --set-slot codex --set-judge claude-code=opus
entire inspect --configure --profile general --set-model codex=gpt-5-codex --set-task "..."
entire inspect --edit --profile general       # Advanced skill-level config (skill picker)
entire inspect --agent <name>           # Run one inspector from the selected profile
entire inspect --agent <name> --model <model>  # Override that inspector's model for this run
entire inspect --agents                 # List the profile's inspectors (valid --agent values)
entire inspect --models                 # List models each agent advertises
entire inspect --models --agent codex   # ...filtered to one agent
entire inspect --prompt "focus on auth" # Add one-off instructions
entire inspect --findings               # Browse local review findings
```

A bare `entire inspect` never silently runs a default crew. In an interactive
terminal it opens a chooser listing the configured profiles (default
pre-selected); in a non-interactive context it prints the profiles and exits
with an error so automation must name a profile explicitly. To tag an
already-finished session as a review after the fact, use
`entire attach --review <session-id>` (the old `entire review attach`
subcommand was removed).

When no profiles are configured, interactive `entire inspect` runs a guided
setup: choose a review focus (or `Custom…` to write the task), build the
inspector crew (a single-screen add/edit/remove slot list seeded with all
launchable agents — the same agent may appear more than once on different or
identical models), then choose the judge that consolidates their reports, and
finally where the verdict should go (local or the branch's trail). It saves the
profile and asks before starting agents.

`entire inspect --configure` is the configuration entry point:
- With `--set-agents` / `--set-slot` / `--set-judge` / `--set-output` /
  `--set-task` / `--set-model agent=model`, it writes the profile
  non-interactively (no TUI).
  `--set-*` writes preserve profile-level fields the flags don't touch (custom
  `task`, etc.).
- With no `--set-*` flags in an interactive terminal, it opens the guided
  wizard (which already lists the selectable agents).
- With no `--set-*` flags in a non-interactive context, it prints the discovery
  view: the **available review agents** (those with review-runner adapters,
  marking which have hooks installed) and the **currently configured profiles**,
  plus an example `--set-*` command. Defaults are intentionally simple:
  Claude/Codex use `/review`, Gemini uses the profile task directly, and Claude
  is preferred as the default judge when available.

When two or more adapter-backed inspectors are configured and `--agent` is not
set, `entire inspect` fans out to all configured inspectors. There is no per-run
multi-picker: the profile is the fan-out contract. Multi-inspector profiles
resolve one judge (explicit, or auto-selected from the inspectors); the judge
runs after the inspectors finish and produces the final verdict.

## Settings Schema

Profiles are configured under `review_profiles` in either the shared project
settings (`.entire/settings.json`, committed) or the per-developer override
(`.entire/settings.local.json`, git-ignored). Guided setup and `--configure`
let the user pick the destination (`--local` for the scripted path); the
non-interactive first run writes the project file. The two layers (plus legacy
clone-local preferences) are **merged per profile name** by `settings.Load`, so
a team can share profiles in the project file while individuals add or override
profiles locally without hiding the shared set. Schema:

```json
{
  "review_default_profile": "general",
  "review_profiles": {
    "general": {
      "task": "Review this change for correctness, regressions, tests, and maintainability.",
      "agents": {
        "claude-code": {"skills": ["/review"]},
        "codex": {"skills": ["/review"]}
      },
      "judge": {"agent": "claude-code", "model": "opus"}
    },
    "security": {
      "task": "Review this change for auth, injection, secrets, and privilege-boundary bugs.",
      "agents": {
        "claude-sonnet": {"agent": "claude-code", "model": "sonnet", "skills": ["/security-review"]},
        "codex": {"model": "gpt-5-codex", "skills": ["/review"], "prompt": "Focus on security."}
      },
      "judge": {"agent": "claude-code", "model": "opus"}
    }
  }
}
```

- The profile-level `task` is the shared work item.
- Each `agents` map entry is an **inspector** id. For simple entries the id is
  the agent name; to run the same agent more than once, use aliases and set
  `agent` plus `model`. Per-inspector `skills`, `prompt`, and `model` adapt the
  task to agent-specific mechanics.
- `judge` is the single agent (+ optional model) that consolidates the
  inspectors' reports into the final verdict. It need not be one of the
  inspectors. It is optional: a one-inspector profile needs none, and a
  multi-inspector profile with no judge set auto-selects a text-gen-capable
  inspector (preferring claude-code, then codex, then gemini).
- `output` selects where the verdict is delivered: `local` (printed and saved
  to the local review manifest — the default; omitted from settings) or `trail`
  (additionally posted to the branch's trail as a finding via the data API).
  Resolved by `profileOutput`; the trail post is wired through the injected
  `Deps.PostReviewToTrail` hook (`review_bridge.go` → `createTrailReviewFinding`).

`entire inspect --models` lists the models each agent advertises via the
optional `agent.ModelLister` capability (`cmd/entire/cli/agent/model_lister.go`).
Only claude-code advertises a list (its curated, real aliases opus/sonnet/haiku).
Agents whose CLI has no enumeration command (codex, gemini) do not implement
`ListModels`; the picker offers only Default + Custom for them, and `--models`
notes there are none. The `--model` flag still forwards any value the agent CLI
accepts.

Settings fields: `EntireSettings.ReviewProfiles` and
`EntireSettings.ReviewDefaultProfile` in `cmd/entire/cli/settings/settings.go`.

## How It Works (env-var handshake)

1. `entire inspect` resolves a profile (positional/`--profile`, else the
   interactive chooser, else — non-interactively — an error). It composes
   inspector prompts via `review.ComposeReviewPrompt` and computes scope
   (mainline base ref via `review.ComputeScopeStats`, overridable with `--base`).
2. **For agents with review-runner adapters** (claude-code, codex, gemini-cli):
   the spawned process is given env vars
   `ENTIRE_REVIEW_{SESSION,AGENT,SKILLS,PROMPT,STARTING_SHA}` that the agent's
   `UserPromptSubmit` lifecycle hook reads to tag the session as
   `Kind = "agent_review"` with the configured skills/prompt. Each spawned
   process has its own env, so multiple worktrees and multi-agent runs are
   correct by construction (no shared marker file, no race).
3. **For agents without review-runner adapters yet**: `RunMarkerFallback` writes
   a `PendingReviewMarker` file and prints guidance — the user opens the agent
   themselves and runs the skills, then tags it with `entire attach --review`.
4. Inspectors run the selected profile's task; each session ends naturally.
5. In multi-inspector profiles, the judge runs after inspectors finish (see
   Multi-Agent UI). It receives all inspector reports and consolidates them into
   the final verdict.
6. On the next `git commit`, the PostCommit hook condenses inspector sessions
   into the checkpoint on `entire/checkpoints/v1`, with `Kind`, `ReviewSkills`,
   and `ReviewPrompt` recorded in `CommittedMetadata`.
7. The `CheckpointSummary` sets `HasReview = true` for O(1) lookup. `HasReview`
   is an umbrella "any review happened" flag.
8. `entire status` and the re-run guard read `HasReview` from the checkpoint
   metadata (no commit history walking).

## Checkpoint Metadata

Review metadata is stored at two levels on `entire/checkpoints/v1`:

- **`CommittedMetadata` (per-session)**: `kind: "agent_review"`, `review_skills:
  ["/skill1", "/skill2"]`, `review_prompt: "..."`
- **`CheckpointSummary` (per-checkpoint)**: `has_review: true` (umbrella; set
  when any session in the checkpoint has a review-kind `Kind`)

## Architecture

- **`AgentReviewer` interface** (`cmd/entire/cli/review/types/reviewer.go`):
  per-agent contract with `Name() string` and `Start(ctx, RunConfig)
  (Process, error)`. Each adapter-backed inspector implements this in its own
  package.
- **`ReviewerTemplate`** (`cmd/entire/cli/review/types/template.go`): shared
  scaffolding (spawn → pipe stdout → run parser → forward events → close +
  bounded stderr capture). Each agent supplies only its `BuildCmd` (argv/env)
  and `Parser` (stdout-to-Event stream).
- **`Sink` interface**: consumers of the event stream. Production sinks:
  `DumpSink` (post-run per-agent narrative), `TUISink` (Bubble Tea live
  dashboard), `SynthesisSink` (final verdict). Composed by
  `composeMultiAgentSinks` based on TTY detection.
- **`Run` / `RunMulti`** (`run.go`, `run_multi.go`): single- and N-agent
  orchestrators. In `RunMulti` each inspector runs concurrently in its own
  goroutine; events fan into a single dispatch loop so the serial-dispatch
  contract holds. Per-inspector skills/prompts are injected via
  `perAgentConfiguredReviewer`.
- **Judge resolution** (`profile.go`): `profileJudge` returns the explicitly
  configured judge (`judge`); `resolveJudge` falls back to `defaultJudge`, which
  auto-selects a text-gen-capable inspector (preferring claude-code, then codex,
  then gemini) when none is set.
- **Synthesis** (`synthesis_sink.go`): the single judge is an
  `AgentSynthesisProvider` consumed by `SynthesisSink`. It receives all
  inspector narratives and writes one verdict; provider failure surfaces as
  "final report unavailable".
- **Env-var contract** (`env.go`): single source of truth for `ENTIRE_REVIEW_*`.
- **Scope detection** (`scope.go`): first existing of
  `origin/HEAD → origin/main → origin/master → main → master`, overridable via
  `--base <ref>` (validated through go-git's `ResolveRevision`).

## Multi-Agent UI

When `RunMulti` is dispatched in a TTY, the sink slice is
`[TUISink, DumpSink, SynthesisSink]`:

- **`TUISink` / `reviewTUIModel`**: live dashboard with one row per inspector;
  `Ctrl+O` drills into an agent's full event buffer; `Ctrl+C` cancels via the
  shared `CancelFunc`. `RunFinished` blocks on dismissal so `DumpSink` renders
  below rather than overlapping.
- **`SynthesisSink`** (`synthesis_sink.go`): after the dump it composes an
  adjudication prompt from all inspector narratives + per-run prompt + profile
  task and calls its `SynthesisProvider` — an `AgentSynthesisProvider` for the
  resolved judge. Skipped when cancelled or fewer than 2 inspectors produced
  usable output. Provider failures degrade gracefully.
- **Sink composition** (`composeMultiAgentSinks` in `cmd.go`): pure helper
  taking explicit `isTTY`/`canPrompt` so tests don't depend on real TTY
  detection.

## Skill Discovery (Claude Code)

`DiscoverReviewSkills` (`cmd/entire/cli/agent/claudecode/discovery.go`) walks
three roots: plugin cache, user skills (`~/.claude/skills`), and user
commands/agents. `pickLatestVersion` picks ONE version directory per plugin
(highest valid semver, else lexicographic max) to avoid duplicate skill entries.

## Anti-Features (do NOT recreate)

- `PendingReviewMarker` for adapter-backed inspectors (env-var handshake makes
  it unnecessary; the marker only backs the manual-attach fallback)
- `WorktreePath`-style marker scoping / `AgentEntries` map (env per process)
- Marker overwrite tripwire / refuse-attach guard
- `--track-only` / `--postreview` / `--finalize` / empty review commits
- `Launcher` + `HeadlessLauncher` as separate interfaces (single `AgentReviewer`)
- Agent-specific stdout post-processing in shared multi-agent code (per-agent
  parsers own their format; shared code only sees `Event` variants)
- Fabricated "example" model lists for agents without an enumeration command
  (codex/gemini advertise nothing; Default + Custom only)
- A "master" worker slot that both reviews and adjudicates in one pass (the
  judge is a separate consolidation round, even when auto-selected from the
  inspectors)
