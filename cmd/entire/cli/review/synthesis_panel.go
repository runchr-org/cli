// PanelSynthesisProvider runs a panel of judges over the inspectors' reports.
// Each judge independently produces a verdict from the same synthesis prompt;
// when two or more verdicts come back, the chair judge merges them into one
// final verdict and the individual verdicts are appended as a panel.
//
// It implements SynthesisProvider, so the existing SynthesisSink uses it
// unchanged — a panel is just a provider that happens to consult several
// judges. A single judge collapses to that judge's verdict (today's behavior).

	ChairIdx int                 // index of the judge that merges the panel
}

// Synthesize fans out to each judge in parallel, then has the chair merge the
// verdicts. Failed judges are dropped; if only one verdict survives it is
// returned directly. If every judge fails, the error is returned so the caller
// can report "final report unavailable".
