// tui_sink.go provides TUISink, a Sink implementation that renders a Bubble
// Tea status dashboard during a multi-agent review run and supports Ctrl+O
// drill-in mode for inspecting one agent's live event buffer. Used in
// interactive (TTY) multi-agent runs; non-TTY runs and single-agent runs use
// DumpSink instead.

// TUISink is a Sink that renders a Bubble Tea dashboard. The orchestrator
// calls AgentEvent/RunFinished from a single goroutine (CU4 serial-dispatch
// contract); the sink translates each event into a tea.Msg and sends it via
// Program.Send. Bubble Tea's Send is thread-safe, but we never rely on that
// property — the serial-dispatch promise means Send is only called from the
// orchestrator's dispatch goroutine.
//
// Cancellation: cancel is the same context.CancelFunc that controls the
// orchestrator's run context. KeyCtrlC in the dashboard calls this function
// (gated by a sync.Once in the model). Out-of-TUI SIGINT routes through the
// cobra root's context, which cancels the same function — no parallel
// signal.Notify goroutine is needed here.
